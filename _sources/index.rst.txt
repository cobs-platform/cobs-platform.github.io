``COBS`` is an open-source and modular co-simulation platform for occupant-centric control of buildings with agent and occupancy simulators. We provide the ability to read the state after each simulation step in EnergyPlus and use it to determine the control action generated by the researcher's control policy. We format the platform similar to the OpenAI Gym, so researchers can port their algorithm to our platform without any problem. COBS's architecture is shown below.
